## Why?

I like the "not on facebook" images, and since the hype in web-design is font
icon, I made a "not on facebook" font icon. (Also, it is easier to integrate a
font icon than an image when you do your design-fu).

I am no designer! So it can **certainly** be improved! Feel free to modify it
and share your work :)

## Usage

Download [not-on-facebook.min.css](not-on-facebook.min.css) and include it in
your project. Then just use the `not-on-facebook` class on any element you want
to have the icon. Magic! See a minimal example of it in use
[here](exemple.html)

The `resources` folder contains all the other font types, `svg` and a bitmap
version of the glyph.
