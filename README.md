# Not on Facebook font icon

![not on facebook icon](https://raw.github.com/Mayeu/not-on-facebook-icon/master/resources/not-on-facebook.png)

### Why?

I like the "not on facebook" images, and since the hype in web-design is
font icon, I made a "not on facebook" font icon. (Also, it is easier to integrate
a font icon than an image when you do your design-fu).

I am no designer! So it can **certainly** be improved! Feel free to modify it and
share your work :)

### Usage

Download [not-on-facebook.css](not-on-facebook.css) and include it in your project. Then just use the `no-facebook` class on any element you want to have the icon. Magic! See a minimal example of it in use [here](index.html)
